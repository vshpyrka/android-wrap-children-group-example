# android-wrap-children-group-example

This serves as an illustration of a custom view group that arranges views in a horizontal manner and shifts them to the next line when they exceed the available space. 

The view customizes the `onMeasure` and `onLayout` methods to correctly position child views when they fit in a horizontal arrangement.
